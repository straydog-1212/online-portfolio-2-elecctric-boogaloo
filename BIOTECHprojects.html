              <img src="images/20181129_131642.jpg"width ="100%">
              <p>This lab started off with kool-aid. We had used it as a substitute for actual lambda DNA
                on account of how expensive it was and how inexperienced we were. After the first trail that effectively served as a proof of concept, we moved on to actual DNA. We were taught about how DNA which is negatively charged. It moves toward the positive end of the circuit when suspended in the agarose gel and how the speed at which it moves is dictated by the size of the cuts. After that, the process of PCR was tacked on in our third attempt and we learned how to use a small strand of DNA to create millions of replica strands and then find out the length using Gel electrophoresis.

              <div class="text">This project was the culmination of everything I had learned at the CART Biotech lab. Over the course of 3 months in groups of four students were tasked with researching a relatively new scientific breakthrough and researching all of the mechanics behind it. After that, we made a poster and a visual aid that would make it easier to explain how the innovation worked. In my groupsâ€™ case, the topic was a recent breakthrough wherein scientists were using genetic engineering and a biological mechanism called a gene drive to give malaria vectors like Anopheles Gambiae a resistance to malaria. Over the three months, we researched the way the disease works, which genes were being targeted and how a Gene Drive works and then presented our findings at the CART showcase to over 3000 people.</div>

              <img src="images\20181107_145644.jpg" width ="100%">
              <p>In this lab, we studied different streaking methods and which were to be used when. We also learned to use entrotubes along with making and using different types of agar to identify various strains of bacteria. After that, we practiced the various streaking techniques and saw which ones yielded the best results.

              <img src="images\20190117_194117.jpg" width ="100%">
              <p> We started this lab off with a bunch of carrots that we sterilized with bleach. After that, we used a hollow tube to extract an uncontaminated sample and put it in a nutrient-rich agar with hormones to stimulate cell division. After a few months, the tissue samples became large calluses that were ready to differentiate. At this point, we added hormones to make the carrot cells differentiate. </p>

              <p>We had this lab during our epidemiology unit. In an attempt to show us how quickly pathogens move from one host to another the teachers used an invisible powder that only shows under a blacklight and let us all learn our epidemiology class for an hour and a half. Afterward, they told us about the powder and showed us how much we all touched our faces, nose and eyes.</p>
