                <div class = "box50"> <p>I was born on November 3, 2001. My hobbies are reading, watching movies, baking, playing video games, and learning (especially) science. I am a senior in high school. I am also a member of the Academic Decathlon.  Currently, I am enrolled in the Center for Advanced Research and Technologyâ€™s Web Application Development. The year previous I took the Biotechnology Lab, where I also volunteer as a lab assistant.</p></div>

        <div class="box3"> 
            <p>I am interested in a career in science or IT with a preference for Genetic Engineering, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, or Chemistry. I am also fond of Programming and Web Design. I will be graduating from high school in 2020. My hope is that after I finish high school I will go to Community College for two years before transferring to either CHSU or Fresno Pacific to get a degree in pharmaceuticals or chemistry. During that time I intend to work on Programming and Web Design as a minor or a hobby. I would like to get int freelance development if the option becomes available. </p>
